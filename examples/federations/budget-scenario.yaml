# Instances of Description (which perform subquery matching against sources)

# is relative to this yaml file). Not all Description implementations do
# this. Currently, only SelectDescription stores the result of the
# "list predicates" and "list classes" queries

# List sources participating in the federation. Each source must have a
# loader specified. Further required properties and their meaning is
# defined by each SourceLoader implementation. The default list of
# implementations is kept in  SourceLoaderRegistry.INSTANCE
sources:
  - loader: swagger  # Load a swagger json/yaml file
    # Swagger files usually have many endpoints and often only a few are used.
    # If you provide the required extensions for only a few endpoints, the remainder
    # will throw errors. Setting this to false turn those errors into warnings.
    # The default is true
    stop-on-error: false,
    # Load from an URI.

    # Load from a file relative to this yaml file. This takes precedence over url
    file: "portal_da_transparencia/portal_transparencia-ext.yaml"
  - loader: rdf-file #Load from a local or remote RDF file (any syntax)
    # relative file path to load. Syntax is derived from file extension
    # as in swagger sources, "file:" has precedence over "url", which
    # is also allowed
