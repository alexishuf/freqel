  # or the HTTP method (get/post/...) of each Swagger endpoint. Each response parser applies to
  # response media types that are accepted by the given media-type property. The "response-parser"
  # property is mandatory and defines the implementation of the response parser. All other
  # properties are specific to the response parser implementation.
